## 📋 About The Project

The dashboard allows users to explore customer data dynamically through several analytical modules:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes key metrics like sales trends over time, top-selling products, and revenue distribution across different countries.
* **K-Means Clustering**: Segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns, helping to identify different customer personas.
* **RFM Analysis**: Scores and segments customers based on their **R**ecency, **F**requency, and **M**onetary value to identify high-value customers and those at risk.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction**: Uses statistical models to forecast the future revenue a customer is expected to generate, enabling strategic marketing and retention efforts.
